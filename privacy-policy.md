# Privacy Policy

Unlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.

Again, **no data or personal information is collected by Stylus**.

Stylus-without-network cuts down all cloud features so the extension cannot tell any server what you're browsing.
