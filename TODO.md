# To-do list

- [.] publish the extension on MS Edge store, or Chrome store

We might consider to do these things...

- [ ] see if we could remove required permissions
- more code removals?
  - [ ] maybe remove firefox stuff, builds other than chrome?
  - [ ] remove rest of usercss, UC?
  - [ ] simplify the data (e.g. `configurable` should no longer be useful)
  - [ ] remove unused files
